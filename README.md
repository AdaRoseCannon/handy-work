# xr-locomotion-starter

Starter repo for THREE.js Locomotion

This is built using THREE.js and compiles with Rollup.

Edit the files in the `src/` directory to make changes.

Dependencies: nodejs

Build steps:

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# compile everything
npm run build

# develop mode
npm run develop

#start a local server
npm run start
```

It's just a static HTML document so sticking it on GitHub pages or any simple http-server would work well.
